# Mandelbrot

This is a visualization of the Mandelbrot set in Javascript and HTML by Nicholas Tomlin, for Melody Chan's MATH 1040: Fundamental Problems of Geometry.

To run the code, download 'index.html' and 'main.js' into the same directory and open index.html with a browser (preferably Chrome). You can edit the parameters of the visualizatin in 'main.js'. Importantly, changing the variable 'zoom = false' to 'zoom = true' will show a different view of the Mandelbrot set.
